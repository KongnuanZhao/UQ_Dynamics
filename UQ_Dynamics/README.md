# UQ_Dynamics
Uncertainty Quantification in Large Dynamical Systems: A framework for faster simulation of dynamical systems with uncertainty in state variables. Based on the idea of linearization, graph clustering, parallel computing and uncertainty propagation

Currently developing the codes in Python platform and making it more user friendly
